# Project 1 Learning Notes
> Note: I think this is a really cool project.  Dr. Liddle has done an amazing job and I feel quite lucky to be able to learn how to recreate this project under his direction.
- Using const declarations for constant variables is much better than having "magic" values within the code.
- Even if there are easier ways to shorten the written code (e.g., multiple `if` statments), it may still be a good idea to write it all out in order to make it more understandable for me in the future.
    - I.e., I should "be nice to \[myself\]".
- I've also been messing around with custom linting through eslint.  Once I figured out how to create & customize the config file, it is a very nice aid to my coding!
- With all the html creation via JavaScript strings, I am beginning to get a sense for how exactly React works (components, etc.).  It must be doing a very similar sort of thing...
- I thought it interesting to see how the `slice` method can be used in an array as well (e.g., `volumes.slice(-1)[0].id`).
- Understanding how to read API documentation is a bit challenging, but once I understood how to make sense of and utilize it, it became key to solving the various problems with the map.
- It's very important to understand the properties of objects that are getting passed around, like markers, so we can access and know how to parse their attributes as needed (e.g., appending multiple titles to an already existing lat/lng combination).
- Sometimes getting dynamic HTML to work/look properly requires creativity. I thought it was cool to be able to use JavaScript to handle the Prev/Next HTML buttons appropriately.
- If I could have approached this project differently, I would have:
    - Spent more time paying attention to what the purpose of each function was.
    - Spend more time understanding the fundamentals of function encapsulation so I can utilize them more readily for custom functions I need to write.
