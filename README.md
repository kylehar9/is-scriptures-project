# Project 1 Learning Notes
> Note: I think this is a really cool project.  Dr. Liddle has done an amazing job and I feel quite lucky to be able to learn how to recreate this project under his guidance.
- Using const declarations for constant variables is much better than having "magic" values within the code.
- Even if there are easier ways to shorten the written code (e.g., multiple 'if' statments), it may still be a good idea to write it all out in order to make it more understandable for me in the future.
    - I.e., I should "be nice to \[myself\]".
- I've also been messing around with custom linting through eslint.  Once I figured out how to create & customize the config file, it is a very nice aid to my coding!
- With all the html creation via JavaScript strings, I am beginning to get a sense for how exactly React works (components, etc.).  It must be doing a very similar sort of thing...
- I thought it interesting to see how the `slice` method can be used in an array as well (e.g., `volumes.slice(-1)[0].id`).
